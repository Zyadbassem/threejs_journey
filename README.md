### Deploying our project

there are many ways to deploy your project but in this lesson we're gonna use Vercel but first you need to sign up so open their website and sign up with email
now you need to add vercel to your project `npm install vercel` and open your package.json file and paste this in the script property

```js
"deploy": "vercel --prod"
```
